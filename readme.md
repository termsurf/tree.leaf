## Overview

This library takes a set of `mine tree` DSLs and generates a code file parser for each. It can then parse a code file using one of the DSLs into the appropriate tree structure. The tree structure might have unresolved interpolation structures and such, this is basically a nice form of the literal text tree that we can use in linting, and in type resolving / checking in the next steps.
